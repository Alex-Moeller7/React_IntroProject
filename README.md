# Starting Project from React Course

## Goal: Learn fine details and advanced techniques of React

This Repo represents the first project of the course and is incredibly basic.
This Repo is simply meant to smooth over any oversight of previous React learning experiences.

In other words, a step back in order to take more steps forwards


Note: Node_Modules is not included in the repo... to run you will need to clone and then run "npm i", then run "ng serve"
